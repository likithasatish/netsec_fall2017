# Network Security

Description
This course focuses on communication security in computer systems and networks. The course is intended to provide students with an introduction to the field of network security. The course covers network security services such as authentication and access control, integrity and confidentiality of data, firewalls and related technologies, Web security and privacy. Course work involves implementing various security techniques. A course project is required.

Instructor Comments: Network Security is a very broad topic and intensely multidisciplinary. In this introductory class, we will learn about engineering a secure network from the ground up. Our exploration begins at the network protocol level (IP, TCP, SSL), and expands from the into core applications built on these protocols such as firewalls, proxies, intrusion detection, and so forth. We will also cover how psychology, cryptography, architectural design, and other principles are combined into engineering a secure network. As part of our discussions and lab work, we will learn about both network attack and defense.

Course Objectives
(1) Understand basic elements of secure network design
(2) Build prototypical security protocols and applications
(3) Explore the basics of network attack and defense

Course Topics
• Usable Security Design 
• Security Protocols and Access Controls
• Network Attacks/Defense
